# Ecornell JCP703

The **JCB703 course** — *Leveraging Data for AI Solutions* (authored by Lutz Finger, SC Johnson College of Business, Cornell University) — teaches how to handle, clean, and ethically apply data to build effective and responsible AI products. It combines technical skills (data collection, cleaning, bias detection) with ethical and business principles for value creation.

Here’s a structured summary of the **core concepts taught**:

---

### **1. The Role and Quality of Data in AI**

* AI systems depend on **high-quality, well-curated, unbiased data** rather than vast quantities of it.
* Students learn to **scrape, clean, and prepare** data using appropriate tools, dealing with missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
* Emphasis is placed on **defining a clear business objective** for AI projects to ensure data serves a meaningful purpose and aligns with organizational goals.

---

### **2. Identifying and Mitigating Bias**

* The course explores **human and systemic biases** (sampling, historical, measurement, etc.) and how they affect AI fairness.
* Students use **statistical and visualization tools** to detect bias and then apply strategies at every stage of AI system design:

  * *Preprocessing* (data cleaning and balancing)
  * *Model training* (fairness constraints)
  * *Post-processing* (output adjustments)
  * *User interface design* (inclusive UX)
* Ethical trade-offs between **business goals and social fairness** are discussed through applied projects, e.g., identifying bias in a coffee dataset.

### **3. Data Ethics, Privacy, and Value Cultivation**

* Students examine how **data privacy, ownership, and utilization** shape business success and public trust.
* The concept of a **“data moat”** is introduced — using proprietary, ethically gathered data to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage.
* Topics include:

  * **Aggregation theory** — how companies like Google or TikTok leverage data to create user value.
  * **Balancing privacy with innovation** — cleaning health data of personally identifiable information while retaining utility.
  * **Regulatory and cultural perspectives** on global data governance.

---

### **4. The “Right Data” and Data Over Algorithms**

* The course emphasizes that **data quality and alignment** with business objectives matter more than algorithmic complexity.
* Students compare cases where data-driven business models (e.g., TikTok vs. Clubhouse) succeeded or failed based on **how data was used to drive value**, not just the technology behind it.

---

### **5. Ethical AI and Responsible Leadership**

* Learners explore how AI development influences **societal outcomes**, emphasizing the shared responsibility of data scientists and product managers.
* Reflection topics include **ethical decision-making**, **transparency**, and **the societal impact of data interpretation** — using historical analogies to highlight how data framing shapes collective futures.

---

### **6. Applied Learning through Projects**

Each module builds on the previous one:

1. **Module 1:** *Scraping and Cleaning the Right Data* — acquire and preprocess relevant datasets.
2. **Module 2:** *Identifying and Addressing Bias* — detect and mitigate bias in data and models.
3. **Module 3:** *Leveraging Data for Principled Value Cultivation* — create a business case for ethical, privacy-aware data utilization.

---

### **Summary**

By the end of JCB703, students are able to:

* Gather and prepare **clean, ethical, and purpose-aligned datasets**.
* Identify, measure, and mitigate **bias and unfairness** in AI systems.
* Understand and apply **data privacy, governance, and competitive strategy** concepts.
* Design **AI products that balance profitability, productivity, and principle** — emphasizing fairness, accountability, and sustainable value creation.
