# **Appendix J — Ethical Treatment of Missing Data**

---

## **1.  Why Missing Data Is an Ethical Issue**

Missing data is not merely a technical inconvenience; it is an ethical signal.
How analysts handle absent values determines whose experiences are represented, whose are ignored, and how reliable resulting insights will be.
Imputation, deletion, or silence about missingness can each amplify bias or obscure truth.

> **Principle:**  Every “blank cell” in a dataset has moral as well as mathematical meaning.

---

## **2.  Categories of Missingness**

| Mechanism                               | Definition                                                                                     | Ethical Interpretation                                                                  | Common Example                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MCAR — Missing Completely at Random** | The probability that a value is missing is unrelated to any variable (observed or unobserved). | Missingness introduces random noise, not bias; safe to handle statistically.            | Random sensor glitch removes 2 % of readings across all devices.              |
| **MAR — Missing at Random**             | Missingness depends on observed data but not on the missing value itself.                      | Can be modeled and corrected, but transparency about assumptions is essential.          | Income missing more often among younger respondents; age variable available.  |
| **MNAR — Missing Not at Random**        | Missingness depends on the unobserved value or sensitive attribute.                            | High ethical risk: systematic bias that hides marginalized groups or negative outcomes. | Patients with severe symptoms less likely to complete post-treatment surveys. |

---

## **3.  Ethical Risks of Mishandling Missingness**

1. **Representation Bias** – Omitting MNAR cases silences vulnerable populations.
2. **Illusory Precision** – Imputing without disclosure conveys false certainty.
3. **Unintended Discrimination** – Patterns of absence correlate with protected attributes.
4. **Transparency Failure** – Reports rarely reveal how much data was missing or why.

> *Ethical rule:*  If data were not collected, acknowledge what voices are unheard.

---

## **4.  Recommended Ethical Actions**

| Step                                     | Technique                                                                                                                        | Ethical Rationale                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Detect and Classify**                  | Examine missing-data patterns and relationships to key variables.                                                                | Distinguish MCAR/MAR/MNAR to choose fair correction.     |
| **Document Extent**                      | Report percentage missing per field; visualize with heatmaps or bar plots.                                                       | Transparency allows stakeholders to judge reliability.   |
| **Choose Repair Strategy Intentionally** | Mean or median imputation (MCAR); regression or multiple imputation (MAR); sensitivity analysis or targeted recollection (MNAR). | Aligns statistical correction with underlying mechanism. |
| **Flag Imputed Values**                  | Add indicator variables identifying replaced data.                                                                               | Prevents unintentional reuse as if observed.             |
| **Communicate Assumptions**              | Include missing-data notes in dashboards and reports.                                                                            | Maintains trust and informed interpretation.             |

---

## **5.  Reflection Prompt — “What’s Missing, and Why?”**

1. What information is absent from your dataset, and whose experience might that hide?
2. Which missingness mechanism (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) best describes it?
3. How could transparency about missing data alter stakeholder confidence?

Encourage documenting answers in project summaries or ethical review checklists.

---

## **6.  Integration with the Course Framework**

* **PVCF Layer 2 (Governance & Design):**  Require documentation of missing-data diagnostics in review templates.
* **Data Value Chain — Collection Stage:**  Examine how data-capture design itself generates missingness.
* **Ethics-Performance Dashboard:**  Add a *Data Completeness Metric* (e.g., percentage of non-missing critical fields).
* **Capstone Projects:**  Deduct points for undisclosed or unjustified imputation decisions.

---

### **Summary of Appendix J**

* MCAR = random absence → low risk.
* MAR = predictable absence → manageable with modeling.
* MNAR = systematic absence → moral hazard; requires reflection and sometimes recollection.
* Ethical data science demands *transparency, justification,* and *communication* of missingness treatment.

> **Final Reminder:**  Every assumption about what is missing is an assumption about whose story is told.  Responsible analysts make those assumptions visible.

# **Appendix K — Outliers, Anomalies, and Ethical Data Integrity**

---

## **1.  Why Outliers Matter Ethically**

Outliers are not just numerical oddities; they are signals that something exceptional—or someone marginalized—may be present.
Deciding whether to *remove, adjust, or investigate* an outlier is both a statistical and moral choice.

> **Principle:**  Treat every extreme value as a potential story, not a nuisance.

Ignoring genuine outliers can erase edge-case realities (patients with rare diseases, under-resourced communities).
Failing to detect false outliers can distort results and create misleading conclusions.

---

## **2.  Types of Outliers**

| Type                     | Description                                            | Typical Source                                          | Ethical Concern                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Measurement Outliers** | Result from instrument or entry error.                 | Sensor glitches, data-entry mistakes.                   | May falsely drive policy if not corrected.     |
| **Contextual Outliers**  | Normal in one context but extreme in another.          | Seasonal demand spikes, regional effects.               | Risk of unfairly labeling groups “abnormal.”   |
| **Behavioral Outliers**  | Represent rare but valid human behaviors.              | Fraud attempts, medical anomalies, innovation patterns. | Over-zealous filtering can suppress diversity. |
| **Structural Outliers**  | Emerge when data from distinct populations are merged. | Combining customer and supplier data in one model.      | Hidden subgroup bias and privacy risk.         |

---

## **3.  Ethical Risks in Outlier Handling**

1. **Bias Amplification** — Deleting extreme but legitimate cases erases under-represented voices.
2. **Manipulative Framing** — Removing outliers to “improve” model fit conceals complexity.
3. **Privacy Exposure** — Publishing small-n outliers can re-identify individuals.
4. **Automation Over-Trust** — Blind IQR/z-score filtering ignores social meaning.

> *Ethical Rule:*  When an outlier affects real people, treat it as evidence, not error—until proven otherwise.

---

## **4.  Ethical Decision Framework for Outliers**

| Step         | Guiding Question                              | Example Practice                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Detect**   | How was the outlier identified?               | Use multiple methods: boxplot, z-score > 3, isolation forest. |
| **Diagnose** | Why might it exist?                           | Compare metadata (time, location, entry source).              |
| **Decide**   | Keep, transform, or remove?                   | Document rationale; apply consistent rule across groups.      |
| **Disclose** | How will others know?                         | Annotate datasets and visualizations with treatment notes.    |
| **Reflect**  | Who could be harmed or erased by this choice? | Re-examine decisions through fairness lens.                   |

Include this audit in project documentation or ethics review forms.

---

## **5.  Visualization Integrity**

Ethical visualization requires showing variability honestly.

**Recommended Practices**

* Display whiskers and outliers on boxplots; avoid cropping scales.
* Use log transforms transparently when magnitudes differ greatly.
* Include contextual annotations (“holiday surge,” “sensor error”).
* For public dashboards, aggregate or jitter rare extreme points to protect privacy.

**Avoid**

* Truncating axes to dramatize differences.
* Removing “problem” points without disclosure.
* Color schemes that exaggerate magnitude perception.

---

## **6.  Analytical Techniques and Their Ethical Caveats**

| Technique                           | Use Case                                | Ethical Reminder                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IQR Filter**                      | Quick detection of univariate extremes. | Verify that excluded values aren’t concentrated in one demographic. |
| **Z-Score / Standard Deviation**    | Normal-distribution assumptions.        | Many social variables are non-normal—context before cutoff.         |
| **Robust Regression / Winsorizing** | Reduce influence of extremes.           | Document thresholds; avoid hiding systemic inequality.              |
| **Isolation Forest / DBSCAN**       | Multivariate anomaly detection.         | Validate features driving classification; explain false positives.  |

---

## **7.  Reflection Prompt — “Exceptional or Excludable?”**

1. What criteria do you use to define an outlier?
2. Who decided those criteria, and on what moral or operational grounds?
3. How might different thresholds change the fairness of your model?
4. Could public transparency about outlier policy build stakeholder trust?

Encourage teams to discuss these questions before final model sign-off.

---

## **8.  Integrating Outlier Ethics into Course Frameworks**

* **Data Value Chain (Analysis Stage):**  Add an “Outlier Ethics Review” step before modeling.
* **Ethics-Performance Dashboard:**  Include a *Data Integrity Metric* = (# investigated outliers ÷ total detected).
* **Capstone Projects:**  Require documentation of outlier detection methods and justifications.
* **Governance Checklists:**  Record whether removal decisions were reviewed by cross-functional teams.

---

## **9.  Summary of Appendix K**

* Outliers may indicate *error, novelty, or inequality*—each demands different action.
* Automatic deletion without explanation is ethically reckless.
* Proper investigation, documentation, and visualization preserve truth and trust.
* Outlier ethics complete the trilogy of **data-quality integrity**:

  * *Missingness (Appendix J)*
  * *Anomalies (Appendix K)*
  * *Transparency & Disclosure* (throughout Parts II–IV).

> **Final Principle:**  Data integrity is moral integrity—accuracy without honesty is still deception.
