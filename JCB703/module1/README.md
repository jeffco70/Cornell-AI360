## **Part 1: Scraping and Cleaning the Right Data**

### **1. Objective of the Module**

This first module establishes the foundational mindset for all AI work: **the quality and purpose of data determine the success of an AI product**. The emphasis is not on having *more data* or *advanced algorithms*, but on having **the right data** — data that aligns with the specific business question being addressed.

Students learn to think like **data product managers**, bridging the gap between business value, data science, and ethical use.

### **2. Key Concepts**

#### **a. Data as the Foundation of AI**

* Data is the **fuel of AI**, but more data does not mean better results.
* AI projects must begin by defining the **intended use case** — e.g., improving product recommendations, reducing churn, or optimizing logistics.
* Data should be **fit for purpose**, not just statistically interesting.

#### **b. Data Collection and Web Scraping**

* Students practice **acquiring raw data** from real-world sources (e.g., AllRecipes, Yelp, etc.) using scraping tools or APIs.
* The process includes:

  * Identifying relevant variables.
  * Respecting website terms of service and privacy rules.
  * Structuring data for downstream processing.

#### **c. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

* Students explore how to:

  * Handle **missing values** and **outliers**.
  * Standardize data types and formats.
  * Normalize categorical and numerical fields.
* The module shows how improper cleaning leads to skewed models and unreliable conclusions.

#### **d. Evaluating Data Quality**

* The course introduces metrics and heuristics for assessing data quality:

  * **Completeness**
  * **Consistency**
  * **Validity**
  * **Timeliness**
  * **Uniqueness**
* Students learn that *bias and noise* are often introduced at the collection and cleaning stages.

#### **e. Data Alignment with Business Value**

* Before analysis, the dataset must connect directly to **a well-defined business objective**.
* Students apply a “Data → Insight → Action → Value” logic chain, ensuring that every variable and feature supports measurable impact.

### **3. Tools and Techniques**

While the course is conceptual, it connects theory to practice by introducing:

* **Python and Pandas** for cleaning and transformation.
* **OpenRefine** or **Excel Power Query** for data wrangling.
* **BeautifulSoup/Selenium** for scraping structured data.
* Visualization (histograms, boxplots) to identify outliers and missing patterns.

---

### **4. Case Study Example**

Students often work with datasets such as recipes, products, or customer reviews.
Through these exercises, they:

* Identify redundant columns.
* Remove duplicates.
* Detect anomalies (e.g., missing ratings or extreme prices).
* Prepare a clean, labeled dataset ready for AI model training.

---

### **5. Conceptual Takeaways**

1. **Good AI requires curated data, not massive data.**
2. **Define the use case before collecting data.**
3. **Bias, inconsistency, and missingness** start early — handle them up front.
4. **Ethical scraping and governance** are mandatory for reproducibility and trust.
5. **The “data pipeline” mindset:** Treat every dataset like a product with inputs, transformations, and outputs tied to value.

---

### **6. End-of-Module Outcome**

By the end of Module 1, students can:

* Collect, clean, and prepare datasets for AI applications.
* Evaluate and improve data quality.
* Articulate how data supports a specific business or societal goal.
* Understand the ethical boundaries of data collection.
